FIRST COMMIT

I Created a First a login where users can login and differentiate the meaning of $GET and $POST.
They are both somewhat the same, but GET is not secure; it can be used if you want to get or process non-sensitive information like race, gender, religion, zip code, and etc...
$POST is more secure because it was not show information from the url because the script is passing it through http post method.
I also created a database for the login i used XAMPP mySQL to collect data.
